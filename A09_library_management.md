A single AcoustID serves as a "cluster" or "bucket" for many different audio fingerprints.

Here is why this happens and why it is important for your script:

The Raw Fingerprint:
     The fingerprint generated by fpcalc is based on the actual audio waveform. If you have a FLAC version, a 320kbps MP3, and a 128kbps MP3 of the exact same song, they will all have mathematically different raw fingerprints because compression alters the waveform data slightly.

The AcoustID:
     The AcoustID server receives these different fingerprints, analyzes them, and determines that they belong to the same recording. It then assigns them all the same unique AcoustID (UUID).

How this affects your script: This is exactly why the _handle_id_deduplication logic we added is critical.

Your Local Fuzzy Match (_handle_local_deduplication) checks if the raw fingerprints are similar (e.g., two MP3s of the same bitrate).

Your Strict ID Deduplication (_handle_id_deduplication) catches cases where the fingerprints are totally different (e.g., FLAC vs. MP3), but AcoustID knows they are the same song. This allows you to upgrade a low-quality file to a high-quality one even if their raw data looks different.
